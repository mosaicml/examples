Title: missing index.json when excuting laion_cloudwriter.py
Date: 05/2023

Question:

laion_cloudwriter.py converted format successfully from parquet to mds, but failed to generate index.json file which is necessary for dataloader in precompute_latents.py. Is this a bug?

Answer:

Because of the missing empty file which is created as "done" in laion_download_aesthetic.sh, laion_cloudwriter.py was stuck in an unlimited loop. If you interrupt the program, index.json will not be created.
