Title: some questions about learning rate
Date: 05/2023

Question: 

In SD-256.yaml, the learning rate is set to 1e-4, I wonder whether the learning rate will be scaled up with the increase of GPUs. For example, if I use 64 GPUs train the model, will the learning rate be scaled to 64*1e-4 automatically?

Answer:

the learning rate should be the same regardless of the number of GPUs. In our code, you will get the same training curve regardless of if you use 1 or 64 (or any other number) of GPUs.
