Title: Issues following instructions on Ubuntu 22.04
Date: 05/2023

Question:

Hi,

I could do with a pointer on what's going wrong here. I've followed instructions, and somehow ended up with Torch 1.13.1 when I think it needs 2.x

Answer:

This repo is currently on torch 1.13.1. Try manually installing torch 1.13.1 (https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/#v1131) before installing llmfoundry.

Question:

Thank you for the help. That got rid of the torch error (on installation of llm-foundry), but still I have the line:

trainer 0.0.20 requires protobuf<3.20,>=3.9.2, but you have protobuf 3.20.3 which is incompatible

Unfortunately I wasn't able to find any obvious answer while searching, and I've found randomly trying things rarely gets me there with python dependency issues

Answer:

It looks like trainer is a package you have unrelated to foundry. I'd suggest trying out foundry in a new, clean environment.
