# MosaicML Inference Model Handlers

This repo contains model handler implementations for various models. They can be used out-of-the box with the yamls provided using the MosaicML inference service.

## Getting Started

First, you'll need access to MosaicML's inference service. You can request access [here](https://forms.mosaicml.com/demo).

After getting started, follow the [MCLI Docs](https://docs.mosaicml.com/projects/mcli/en/latest/quick_start/quick_start_inference.html) for quick start instructions.

Once you have `mcli` set up, take a look at the README for each of the models in this repo for the command to deploy the model.
